### The Journey of Feedback and Changes 
- **Project II Feedback Changes**
  Following are changes suggested by further user feedback(after I refined my shorthand) and the professors   comments. I detail on how I tackle each of them:
  
  1. Add specific context in terms of Digitization, the need for Digitization, Edtech
  2. Improve the Call to Actions: Make them more actionable
  3. Build the story around the visualizations
     
- **Final Changes**
  This section deals with aspects of the project, I worked on refining/changing myself - not specific to user feedback.
