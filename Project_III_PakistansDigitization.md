In an era where digital transformation is reshaping societies worldwide, Pakistan stands at a pivotal juncture on its own journey. The digital divide remains a formidable challenge, with limited internet access and disparities in digital skills hindering inclusive development. However, in the unfolding narrative of Pakistan's digital transformation, the influence of mobile connectivity emerges as a pivotal channel. The widespread penetration of mobile phones has positioned them as powerful tools for driving digital progress across the nation. Nevertheless, as with any transformative journey, challenges persist. The limited connectivity in rural areas and the disparity in access to devices represent obstacles that can be overcome through innovation. To fully unlock the potential of Pakistan's digital transformation, it is imperative that policymakers, entrepreneurs, and change-makers harness the power of mobile phone connectivity. By championing EdTech and skill development, they can pave the way for a future marked by inclusive and sustainable progress.

### The Building Blocks
Here we navigate the journey of how this idea and project came into being:

- ### [Part I](https://hibahassan96.github.io/hibah-tswd-portfolio/Project_I_PakistansDigitization.html)
  In the first part of the project, I set out to construct an initial narrative, driven by my interests, the data at my disposal, and my perception of its significance. My goal was to delve deeper into the potential of technology and its capacity to drive socioeconomic change, with a specific focus on Pakistan, a developing nation. I aimed to establish a connection between digitization, human development, and economic well-being, seeking to comprehend the interplay of digital access and services in reshaping Pakistan's current landscape and identifying its shortcomings.To weave this narrative, I curated a selection of datasets and research papers. These sources encompassed a range of valuable data, including statistics on individuals using the internet, the prevalence of secure internet servers, insights from the GSMA Connectivity Index, the UNDP Human Development Index, and data on GDP growth.My approach to Part 1 involved a thorough exploration of these datasets and research papers, allowing me to gain a comprehensive understanding of the digitization landscape in Pakistan and its far-reaching implications. At this instance, the development of this project seeked to deliver a compelling and informative narrative that shed light on the critical intersection of connectivity, prosperity, and well-being in Pakistan's digital transformation journey.

- ### [Part II](https://hibahassan96.github.io/hibah-tswd-portfolio/Project_II_PakistansDigitization.html)
  The second phase of the project aimed to bring the conceptual narrative to life by developing concrete wireframes and a well-structured storyline, supported by moodboards. To effectively convey the data-driven aspects of the narrative, I used tools like Flourish and Infogram to transform raw data into informative charts and graphics. During this stage, the project's focus was refined, determining the intended audience and conducting user research to gather valuable feedback. The user research process played a crucial role in assessing whether the narrative was effectively communicated, whether the visual elements were engaging and informative, and how the audience was perceived. This user feedback became instrumental in driving subsequent changes and refinements, ultimately preparing the project for its third phase.

- ### [Part III](https://hibahassan96.github.io/hibah-tswd-portfolio/Project_III_PakistansDigitization.html)
  In the final phase of the project, all the pieces of the narrative puzzle came together. This stage provided the opportunity to fine-tune the storyline, incorporate valuable user feedback, and implement these refinements on the main website. Moreover, it allowed for a more precise and polished narrative, which was initially broad in scope. Beginning with some uncertainty about the project's direction, the journey through the various phases, including additional primary and secondary research, eventually led to a refined focus on educational technology. The final narrative was enriched with a clear understanding of the target audience and specific calls to action, making for a cohesive and impactful conclusion. Details on this phase are explained ahead.

### The Audience
In the initial stages of the project, the target audience was broad, reflecting the evolving narrative's scope. However, as the project progressed into Phase II, the audience segmentation became more refined. It included two primary categories: the "General Audience," encompassing individuals without in-depth expertise but crucial for awareness campaigns, and the "Focused/Expert Audience," consisting of policymakers, business leaders, and academic professionals. By the time Phase III was reached, while the identified audience segments remained consistent, I gained a deeper understanding of each segment's role. Ultimately, the primary focus of the narrative was tailored to policymakers, entrepreneurs in the edtech sector, students, and teachers, ensuring a more effective and targeted communication approach.

### The Journey of Feedback and Changes 
- **Project II Feedback Changes**
  Following are changes suggested by user feedback(during part II, post part II and the professors comments) I detail on how I tackle each of them:
  
  1. Add specific context in terms of Digitization, the need for Digitization, Edtech
  2. Refine the human development/edtech components
  3. Improve the Call to Actions: Make them more actionable
  4. Build the story around the visualizations
     
- **Final Changes**
  This section deals with aspects of the project, I worked on refining/changing myself - not specific to user feedback.
