# A journey through visualization of Government Debt
## OECD Government Debt 2022
The government debt data shows the debt-to-GDP ratio that acts as a key indicator for the sustainability of government finance. 
We observe that US, Greece and Japan rank as the top 3 countries with the highest debt-to-GDP ratio as compared to the other countries for the year 2022.

## Government Debt Trends Across Time (1995-2022)
The following visualization digs deeper into government debt trends and represents how the debt-to-GDP ratio has evolved over a period of over 20 years across 42 countries.

## Comparative Government Debt Analysis Across Time (2019-2022)
The following visualization attempts to simplify the comparative analysis for OECD countries government debt across 2019-2022 by ranking them from highest to lowest. With the aid of this visualization we recognize how Japan, Greece and USA continue to have the highest debt-to-GDP ratio.

### Reflection and Analysis of the Visualizations Above
The data presented on this page is primarily government debt across different time periods of different countries around the world. The data for all three has been sourced from the OECD website. What I have attempted to do here is represent that the same data can be used to tell different stories just by using different modes of visualizations. 
> The first visualization *OECD Government Debt 2022* is a simple bar chart extracted from the OECD website, that represents the government debt for the year 2022.  The chart is very simplistic and clean but conveys the data and message very well - as the title is well placed, the axis is well labelled and the bars are easily readable. This shows us how minilistic designs can help convey a wide range of information in an effective manner.

> The second visualization *Government Debt Trends Across Time (1995-2022)* is a line chart that breaks down a time-series analysis for each of the countries and represents a trend of their government debt between 1995-2022. On first glance the chart may seem overwhelming but given the subtle color scheme, the bolding of the country headers and a clear grid space, one does not feel flustered by looking at the visualization but is rather able to easily identify a section to focus on and study in depth. The dot spark line allows the trend to be represented in a more crisp manner.

> The final visualization *Comparative Government Debt Analysis Across Time (2019-2022)* is basically an interactive hierarchial map that shows the government debt journey through time. The minimilism in color scheme helps one understand how the same three countries continue ranking the highest through the three years, the numbers at the end of the bars help one understand the magnitude by which the ratio differs. I chose to add the header with a simplistic one liner to communicate the gist of the data but also let the viewer interact and explore the trends by themselves. I wanted the user to feel connected with the visualization and the small element of changing the years and interacting with the visualization is what made me opt for this particular one.
