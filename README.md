# Telling Stories with Data
## Hiba Hassan

# A bit about me
A graduate student pursuing a Masters in Public Policy Management and Data Analytics from Carnegie Mellon University. 
I embarked on a journey half way across the world (literally) to broaden my personal, academic and professional horizons. While I navigate around the world of Data Analytics, the creative person in me
just wanted to be able to translate all those technical skills into something more fun. Therefore, this portfolio is a representation of my attempt at bringing those two worlds together. Through the course 'Telling Stories with Data', learning from Professor Christopher Goranson I have been able to dig deeper into this realm. 

# The Journey 
I started of this course having basic knowledge in reference to exploratory data visualizations using python and R. This course not only introduced me to some very unique and easy to use technical tools (like Tableau, Flourish, Infogram), it allowed me to truly think beyond the numbers/data. I think no amount of data analysis, no matter how perfect and detailed it is, can have its full impact unless coupled with a visual storyline - it completely changes how the data is absorbed, its impact on the audience. 

# My Portfolio
Here is a comprehensive list of projects I have worked on/continue to work on, in my data and storytelling journey:
