# About Me
Hey! I am a graduate student pursuing a Masters in Public Policy and Data Analytics. I enjoy exploring creative ways to translate data into interactive and fun visualizations!

# What I hope to learn
I hope to expand my understanding of visualizing and storytelling skillset, so as to play around with data and produce some very unique but informative data visualizations.
Furthermore, I hope to utilize these learnings in order to enhance work within the data science for social good realm.
