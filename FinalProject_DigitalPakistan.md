# The Digital Transformation Narrative - Pakistan's Perspective
## Exploring the nexus of Connectivity, Prosperity and Well-being

### Introduction 
Digitization has redefined the global sphere. Covid'19 initiated a structural shift in terms of digitization across various sectors and this has ultimately pushed the global narrative towards a journey of digital transformation. One can not ignore this aspect and expect advancement, as this change has transformed social and economic models. 
Pakistan, a developing country, has its digitization narrative set a bit differently. While there has been improvement in digitization models the past few years, the country has a long way to go before it can
considered an important digital economy in the global space. This project aims to dig deeper into Pakistan's current digitization levels, its correlations with various socio-economic dynamics and introduce a way forward. 

Let us go on a visual journey on dissecting the digital transformation narrative of Pakistan!

### Digital Transformation
A 2023 snapshot
- 87.35 million internet users
- 36.7% of internet penetration
- 30.1% of the total population are social media users 
- 80.5% of the total population have active cellular connections

#### Digital Access 
An important aspect of digital transformation is the access and utilization of internet by individuals, the following bar chart shows a trend across years of Pakistan's internet usage and provides a
comparison with the overall World data.

The sketch represents how Pakistan lags behind in terms of internet usage across its people and this is further explored in terms of the digital infrastructure that is offered within the country through an 
an analysis of Secure Internet servers (per 1 million people).

We observe a conflicting trend, with the number of secure internet servers falling around 2020, at a time when COVID was at its peak and the need for digital infrastructure and services was imperative.
We also observe how drastically low Pakistan numbers as showing how weak the overall digital infrastructure is as compared to the World.

#### Connectivity Trends 
The GSMA Connectivity Index is a multitude measure of accessibility, mobile connectivity and digitization across regions. Mobile connectivity plays a crucial role in digital inclusion and equity. Especially,
for a developing economy where the largest technological penetration is that of a mobile/cellular system, we utilize this index to analyze Pakistan's current mobile connectivity state.

Now, we are talking about digital transformation and connectivity, it has become apparent that Pakistan is not doing too well in this sphere but the core of this is not just digitization but how in essence, 
this is impacting the socio-economic sphere of the country.

## The Nexus 
### Human Development 
- A literacy rate of 62%
- Digital Skills Gap Index Ranking at 94 out of 134, a score of 3.9 out of 10
- An analysis of the HDI and how it relates to digitization efforts

### Economic Welfare 
- The overall GDP growth observes a dip in 2020, post COVID, this can majorly be rooted in the fact that Pakistan's digital infrastructure was not able to cater to the digitization needs that COVID brought

### Conclusion 
- A concluding graph that shows digitization initiatives in the recent years (edtech, digital pakistan initiative etc)

### Data Sources
1. Individuals Using the Internet	https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/number-of-internet-users
2. Secure Internet servers (per 1 million people)	https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IT.NET.SECR.P6?view=chart

5. Human Development Index (HDI) 	https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/documentation-and-downloads

We use 5 different data sources to build the narrative of digitization and its impact on various socio-economic factors. Majority of the data has been accessed through the World Bank, rest from UN, GSMA 
own website and Our World in Data. These data sources are utilized as they provide extensive data on many different countries, across a long time period therefore, allowing me to play around and do a deeper 
dive into my data story by also introducing comparisons between Pakistan and other/world metrics. 

### Method and Medium 
The final project will be completed using the following tools:
- Shorthand to bring the entire story together 
- Flourish for certain visualizations
- Tableau for certain visualizations
- I would like to experiment with GIS storymaps, I want to build a narrative around how digitization is truly impacting the socio-economic dynamics and this is where I want to use visuals beyond just graphs, but
  rather some impactful images accessed through public-open source web pages - I want my audience to go on an emotional journey.
