## Wireframes and Storyboards 
Curious about how a developing country can redefine its progress by channeling its digital transformation, I set the stage for Pakistan through this project. 
Utilizing connectivity as a representation of digitized penetration across the country, I aim to identify the impact this would have on skill development and employment avenues within Pakistan. 

The story flow is as follows:
1. Digital Transformation (An introduction)
2. Connectivity and Access in Pakistan (An Overview)
3. Redefining the skill development and employment landscape
4. Call to Action

Delving deeper into the topic, I wireframe the narrative using shorthand. Shorthand allows the narrative to be built through a more visual support. 
Therefore, you may access the **Shorthand: https://preview.shorthand.com/f0VL0RSaMQNXBT8p**

- Possible data visualizations

## User Research
### Target Audience 
The target audience for this project can be broken down into two categories:
  - **General Audience**
     -  _Masses/Citizens_ :these individuals may not have the specific expertise or understanding of the topic but act as the individuals we aim our awareness campaign towards
       There is a limitation as to how I access these individuals but a good start would be through the aid of social media channels like Whatsapp groups, Twitter, Instagram and Reddit.
    
  - **Focused/Expert Audience**
      - _Policy Makers_: Specific government agencies that are working within the digitization realm - an example being Tariq Malik (NADRA Chairman, Pakistan)
      - _Business Leaders_: Individuals/Organizations with initiatives revolving around digitization - an example being Tania Aidrus (Founder of DGlobal -https://www.din.global/)
      - _Students/Academic Faculty_: Individuals in academia that are aware of the realm and would have concrete feedback/contribution

### User Interviews 
**Interview Questions**
1. What is digitization, in your understanding?
2. What is your understanding of Pakistan's digitzation landscape?
3. What is your first impression/understanding of the narrataive here?
4. How is the flow of the story?
5. How are the visualizations and what improvements would you recommend?
6. In your opinion, who is the target audience here?
7. What was an interesting thing here - that you learnt from/found new - you can answer none as well.
8. Final suggestions - what elements work for you, what elements would you change and what additional things can be added here?

**User 1: Graduate Student - MBA, Male, Late 20s**
1. What is digitization, in your understanding? The process of introducing digital services within different sectors, I believe
2. What is your understanding of Pakistan's digitzation landscape? It is still in its beginning phases, I know there is a digital pakistan initiative
3. What is your first impression/understanding of the narrataive here? The story here is introducing us to Pakistan's digital landscape, it focuses it on skill development and offers some specific action items
4. How is the flow of the story? I found it easy to follow 
5. How are the visualizations and what improvements would you recommend? I enjoyed the visualizations - the moving bar charts were interesting
6. In your opinion, who is the target audience here? From the narrative - a government body or individuals in education sector of Pakistan
7. What was an interesting thing here - that you learnt from/found new - you can answer none as well. Got to know a bit about Pakistans digital ecosystem, GSMA connectivity index was something new for me
8. Final suggestions - what elements work for you, what elements would you change and what additional things can be added here? Add more content with the visualizations, the last parts need more detailed working on them

**User 2: Graduate Student - Policy Student, Female, Mid 20s**
1. What is digitization, in your understanding? Basically, focusing on digital policy, it is identifying opportunities in digital enhancement of various services. 
2. What is your understanding of Pakistan's digitzation landscape? The landscape is pretty new, there are alot of inherent infrastructural problems that inhibit Pakistan from pursuing a more rigorous approach towards digitization. There are some initiatives that are working on it though, their impact however, I am not really sure about that. 
3. What is your first impression/understanding of the narrataive here? The narrative here tries to proxy connectivity as digitization for Pakistan and then relates this to its impact on human development, with an eventual focus on digital skill/employment development
4. How is the flow of the story? The flow is good untill the human development part - i found that a bit abrupt, maybe a line or two bridging the connection between digitization and human development would be helpful
5. How are the visualizations and what improvements would you recommend? I liked the visualizations overall, the HDI graph can be edited a bit - maybe use a line graph? but I dont mind it as it is either
6. In your opinion, who is the target audience here? Policymakers / Academics
7. What was an interesting thing here - that you learnt from/found new - you can answer none as well. Didnt realize Pakistan ranked so poorly on the digital gap index
8. Final suggestions - what elements work for you, what elements would you change and what additional things can be added here? I think just bringing the narrative together towards the end would be helpful.
   
**User 3: Professional, Male, Early 30s (working in Pakistani Fintech)**
1. What is digitization, in your understanding? In terms of digital transformation, it is basically incorporation of digital services/technologies to different processes to improve efficiency across the board. It is really the need of the hour - entire economies have gone through some drastic digital transformations since COVID'19.
2. What is your understanding of Pakistan's digitzation landscape? I would say the current landscape is a bit weak, mainly because of various political and economic turmoils the country is going through. However, in the recent past due to the entrance of tech startups and expansion of the fintech/edtech space, Pakistan has definitely incorporated digitization in its development journey - we still have a long way to go though.
3. What is your first impression/understanding of the narrataive here? As I skimmed through it, I see that the stage is set with some basic facts/figures and then connectivity is taken as an approach towards digitization - it is specifically targeting digital skill development and employment transfromation. 
4. How is the flow of the story? I liked the overall flow - the human development bit off.
5. How are the visualizations and what improvements would you recommend? I liked them 
6. In your opinion, who is the target audience here? Policymakers, Entrepreneurs in the tech space
7. What was an interesting thing here - that you learnt from/found new - you can answer none as well. - 
8. Final suggestions - what elements work for you, what elements would you change and what additional things can be added here? I would say make the last part a bit more specific in terms of the call to action, also add content with some of the visualizations. Look into the current edtech/fintech space - especially the startups working in this space, there is alot of interesting work happening!

### Interview Findings
Having had these discussions at an individual level as well as in a group, the topic was well-recieved. I tried to share this narrative with both sets of groups - those that had context of Pakistan and those who didnt - both said that they felt the story was important. I also recieved positive feedback on most of the visualizations, with some comments regarding color scheming/some contexual reference required for some visualizations.

### Areas of Improvement
1. Need to bring the narrative together towards the last part
2. Create a more targetted approach towards the call to action section (I have to work on refining it on shorthand, maybe that is another reason it was not well recieved)
3. Work on the Dimension Scores Graph bars
