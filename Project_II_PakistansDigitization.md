## The Digital Transformation Narrative - Pakistanâ€™s Perspective
### Exploring the nexus of Connectivity, Prosperity and Well-being
### Project II 

## Wireframes and Storyboards 
Curious about how a developing country can redefine its progress by channeling its digital transformation, I set the stage for Pakistan through this project. 
Utilizing connectivity as a representation of digitized penetration across the country, I aim to identify the impact this would have on skill development and employment avenues within Pakistan. 

The story flow is as follows:
1. Digital Transformation (An introduction)
2. Connectivity and Access in Pakistan (An Overview)
3. Impact on Human Development (Skill Development and Employment)
4. Call to Action

Delving deeper into the topic, I wireframe the narrative using shorthand. Shorthand allows the narrative to be built through a more visual support. Therefore, you may access the **Shorthand** here to explore the following:
- Story wireframe
- A moodboard
- Possible data visualizations

## User Research
### Target Audience 
The target audience for this project can be broken down into two categories:
  - **General Audience**
     -  _Masses/Citizens_ :these individuals may not have the specific expertise or understanding of the topic but act as the individuals we aim our awareness campaign towards
       There is a limitation as to how I access these individuals but a good start would be through the aid of social media channels like Whatsapp groups, Twitter, Instagram and Reddit.
    
  - **Focused/Expert Audience**
      - _Policy Makers_: Specific government agencies that are working within the digitization realm - an example being Tariq Malik (NADRA Chairman, Pakistan)
      - _Business Leaders_: Individuals/Organizations with initiatives revolving around digitization - an example being Tania Aidrus (Founder of DGlobal -https://www.din.global/)
      - _Students/Academic Faculty_: Individuals in academia that are aware of the realm and would have concrete feedback/contribution
