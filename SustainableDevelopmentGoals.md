## Narrating the progression of Sustainable Development Goals across India (2016-2021)
Attainment of Sustainable Development Goals can be viewed as a key step towards a brighter future for developing countries. In the pursuit of this, India has promised to achieve its SDGs by 2030. 
In order for this to be a success, India must currently take targeted steps towards deployment of these SDGs driven projects in specific areas. The research focuses on providing a mid-line assessment
of the progress across 707 distrcists of India for 33 SDG indicators. 
The research can be accessed through this: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lansea/article/PIIS2772-3682%2823%2900015-X/fulltext#secsectitle0075

## Selection and Critique of a Visualization 
The visualization I have chosen is a key part of the research discussed above. The following visualization represents the progression/success of SDGs thus far, across various districts of India.

The figure is detailed in the article, as follows:
> Fig. 1: Distribution of districts (count) for Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicators by district status. Total Number of Districts for the following SDG Indicators are not 707: Health Insurance (Men) – 704; Anaemia (Pregnant Women) – 706; Tobacco Use (Men) – 704; Partner Violence (Physical) – 704; Partner Violence (Sexual) – 704; Partner Violence (Physical or Sexual) – 704; Own Mobile Phone (Women) – 704; Have Bank Account (Women) – 704; Teenage Sexual Violence – 704. For underlying data see Table S2.

Reasons for Selection:
- The visualization gives an initial understanding of the premise of what it is trying to convey - ie SDGs related to number of districts however, it takes the viewer quite sometime to navigate around the image to understand what it is really talking about
- There is an absence of a concise title
- The numbers are tough to deduce
- The key is isolated to the right, so it is not apparent what the colors represent
- Selection of colors is not the best - the shades are too close together for the human eye to detect an initial difference
- Not a fan of stacked bar charts as I feel the viewer has to put in alot of effort to deduce information from it
- The narrative: The image needs to tie in closely with the content of the research paper but it takes the viewer in an alternative path where the viewer is left overwhelmed and a bit confused by what exactly is the progression of each of the indicators according to districts

## Sketch and Feedback
I wanted to simplify the amount of information the user is taking at a time and reduce the amount of effort the user will have to put in to derive conlusions(ie numbers) from the visualization. I attempted two sketches and asked for feedback from three individuals.
The sketches and feedbacks are as follows:

**Sketch 1**: This sketch focuses on:
- dealing with each indicator individually by providing an interactive filter on the top
- seperating the bars for each progression based on color

**Feedback on Sketch 1**
- **Respondent 1: Male, 25 Year Old, Student:**
    - I believe the visualization is showing information on internet use for different districts and it looks like it is based on different scales like on target, off target etc
    - I was a bit confused what SDGs it is referring to - maybe adding a subtitle/information on country and dates would be helpful
    - The audience looks like someone who is involved in development sector - could be working or a student or policymaker
- **Respondent 2: Female, 32 Year Old, Professional:**
    - The visualization tells me how internet use is spread across different districts and also, that there are different categories on which this is being analyzed on
    - The color scheme can be improved, a better or more informative title would be helpful
    - Intended audience would be a policymaker looking to analyze which SDGs need more focus

**Feedback on Sketch 2**
- **Respondent 1: Female, 27 Year Old, Student:**
  - The visualization tells me that there are different SDGs for which we are trying to understand the positioning of across a certain number of districts
  - I am a bit confused about what geographical area and time period it refers to
  - Not a huge fan of the color scheme
   
- **Respondent 2: Female, 38 Year Old, Professional:**
    - The visualization is sharing data on different SDGs and their current status across different districts
    - The grid line looks like it is boxing the graph too much
    - I would prefer a more detailed title but also an explantion of what the On-target, Off-Target etc mean

 ## Final Visualization 
 Taking into account the feedback on my sketches and exploration of the visualization tool, I attempted the following remakes for the visualization:
 
 **Attempt 1**
 - I chose the Bar Chart (grouped) layout to visualize the data - with filter on the indicators
 - Through this visualization, I am able to filter on each of the indicators one by one and opt for the indicator that I would be most interested in without being distracted by all other indicators
 - The color scheme is in line with what one interprets the colors to be red-is bad, green and blue-is on track/good
 - I also added numbers at the end of the bars for easier numerical understanding 
 - A short but informative title/subtitle to clarify what the visualization is about, the geography and timeline
 - The footer helps explain what each of the category represents making it easier to understand

  **Attempt 2**
 - I chose the Bar Chart (grouped) layout to visualize the data 
 - Through this visualization one is able to review all of the 33 indicators at once, sorted by Achieved(highest to lowest)
 - It is a cleaner visualization as it has all the indicators but the viewer can easily identify the categories and numerical values for each 
 - The color scheme is in line with what one interprets the colors to be red-is bad, green and blue-is on track/good
 - A short but informative title/subtitle to clarify what the visualization is about, the geography and timeline
 - The footer helps explain what each of the category represents making it easier to understand
