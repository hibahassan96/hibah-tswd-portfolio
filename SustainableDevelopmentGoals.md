## Narrating the progression of Sustainable Development Goals across India (2016-2021)
Attainment of Sustainable Development Goals can be viewed as a key step towards a brighter future for developing countries. In the pursuit of this, India has promised to achieve its SDGs by 2030. 
In order for this to be a success, India must currently take targeted steps towards deployment of these SDGs driven projects in specific areas. The research focuses on providing a mid-line assessment
of the progress across 707 distrcists of India for 33 SDG indicators.

## Selection and Critique of a Visualization 
The visualization I have chosen is a key part of the research discussed above. The following visualization represents the progression/success of SDGs thus far, across various districts of India.

The figure is detailed in the article, as follows:
> Fig. 1: Distribution of districts (count) for Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicators by district status. Total Number of Districts for the following SDG Indicators are not 707: Health Insurance (Men) – 704; Anaemia (Pregnant Women) – 706; Tobacco Use (Men) – 704; Partner Violence (Physical) – 704; Partner Violence (Sexual) – 704; Partner Violence (Physical or Sexual) – 704; Own Mobile Phone (Women) – 704; Have Bank Account (Women) – 704; Teenage Sexual Violence – 704. For underlying data see Table S2.

Reasons for Selection:
- The visualization gives an initial understanding of the premise of what it is trying to convey - ie SDGs related to number of districts however, it takes the viewer quite sometime to navigate around the image to understand what it is really talking about
- There is an absence of a concise title
- The numbers are tough to deduce
- The key is isolated to the right, so it is not apparent what the colors represent
- Selection of colors is not the best - the shades are too close together for the human eye to detect an initial difference
- The narrative: The image needs to tie in closely with the content of the research paper but it takes the viewer in an alternative path where the viewer is left overwhelmed and a bit confused by what exactly is the progression of each of the indicators according to districts

## Sketch and Feedback
I wanted to simplify the amount of information the user is taking at a time and reduce the amount of effort the user will have to put in to derive conlusions(ie numbers) from the
